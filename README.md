### Translation

We are using crowdin + react-intl for translations. It works like this

1. Text is rendered using FormatMessage component which is imported from react-intl. The default message is the message which appears if a translation is missing.
2. The id of the text is generated using hash function.
3. `yarn extract` command extracts the default messages from the code and assign them an id. These are stored in en.json file.
4. The en.json file is uploaded to crowdin using `yarn crowdin:upload` command.
5. After translating text, translations can be downloaded using the command `yarn crowdin:download`

### Stripe

To make stripe checkout work you need their webhooks to reach your machine. Do this by running `./scripts/forward-stripe-webhooks.sh` (you'll need the stripe CLI and to have logged in using `stripe login` before that) in a terminal in the background. That command will also give you a webhook secret in the format `whsec_123...`, you should set the env var `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value.
